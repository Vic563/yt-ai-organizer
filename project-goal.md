1. **Performance Dashboard Overhaul**:
   - Completely rewrote component to use tables instead of charts
   - Fixed React import issues and component structure
   - Removed chart.js dependencies to eliminate rendering errors
   - Added proper TypeScript/JavaScript syntax
   - Implemented responsive design with Material UI tables

2. **Backend Performance API**:
   - Fixed SQLite compatibility by replacing PERCENTILE_CONT function
   - Added manual percentile calculation in Python
   - Fixed missing sqlite3 import
   - Updated response structure to match frontend expectations

3. **API Path Consistency**:
   - Removed duplicate `/api/api/` prefixes in frontend requests
   - Ensured all API calls use correct `/api/` prefix
   - Fixed 404 errors in performance endpoints

### üéØ Current Application State

## üö® Important Notes

1. **User Persona**: Single technically-proficient user (David, AI researcher)
2. **API Keys Required**: Google AI Studio API Key + Google Cloud Project credentials
3. **Cost Consideration**: Conversation history increases token usage - implement sliding window
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Critical for switching between discovery/synthesis modes
5. **Local Storage**: Transcripts stored as .txt files, metadata in SQLite

## üéØ Success Metrics to Track
- Conversation depth (average turns per session)
- Task success rate (finding videos/getting answers)
- API cost per conversation
- User engagement and retention

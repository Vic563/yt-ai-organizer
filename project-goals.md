# Project Goals: YouTube Chat Organizer

## Main Objective
To develop and enhance the YouTube Chat Organizer application, focusing on robust functionality, user experience, and performance monitoring. Key areas include:
- Efficiently organizing and processing YouTube chat data.
- Providing insightful analytics and summaries from chat interactions.
- Ensuring a stable and performant application, both frontend and backend.
- Implementing a comprehensive Performance Dashboard for monitoring API and application health.

## Key Features & Milestones

### Core Application
- YouTube video processing and chat data extraction.
- AI-powered chat analysis using Gemini API.
- Topic identification and summarization.
- Database storage for chat data, topics, and performance metrics.

### Performance Dashboard
- **Objective**: Fully fix and stabilize the Performance Dashboard.
- **Initial Rewrite (Completed)**:
    - Replaced unstable chart components with robust table-based views.
    - Added summary metric cards: total requests, average response time, error rate.
    - Implemented a tabbed interface: "Endpoint Statistics" and "Slow Endpoints".
    - Added time range selector (1 hour to 1 week).
    - Added refresh button with loading state.
    - Implemented visual indicators for error rates.
    - Added fallback UI for empty data and API fetch errors.
    - Removed `react-chartjs-2` and `chart.js` dependencies.
- **Metric Accuracy (Completed)**:
    - Modified backend middleware (`performance_middleware.py`) to exclude logging of internal performance API requests (`/api/performance/`). This ensures metrics reflect only user-initiated Gemini API calls.
- **Reset Functionality (Completed)**:
    - Added a "Reset Metrics" button to the Performance Dashboard.
    - Implemented a backend API endpoint (`DELETE /api/performance/reset-metrics`) to clear all stored performance metrics from the `performance_metrics` table.
    - Added a confirmation dialog in the frontend before resetting.
- **UI Enhancements (Completed)**:
    - Improved text contrast for the time range selector label and "Last updated" timestamp on the Performance Dashboard (text changed to white/light for better visibility against dark backgrounds).

### Backend Enhancements
- FastAPI framework.
- SQLite database.
- Performance tracking middleware.
- Robust API endpoints for chat processing and performance monitoring.
- Fixed SQL compatibility issues for percentile calculations in performance metrics.

### Frontend Enhancements
- React with Material UI.
- User-friendly interface for chat interaction and performance monitoring.
- Clear error handling and loading states.

## Current Status
- Backend: Running on port 8000, all core APIs and performance APIs (including reset) are functional.
- Frontend: Running on port 3000, UI is responsive.
- Performance Dashboard: Fully operational with table-based interface, accurate metrics, reset functionality, and improved UI contrast.
- Application code is ready for initial push to the remote repository.

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements (General)
- [ ] Further refine UI/UX based on user feedback.
- [ ] Explore options for persistent storage beyond SQLite for scalability if needed.
- [ ] Add more detailed analytics or visualizations if requested.
- [ ] Comprehensive end-to-end testing.
